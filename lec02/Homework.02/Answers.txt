1. Boolean value in python is either True or False
example: 5 == 6 # false
	 5 * 0 == 0 # true
	 5+1== 6 #true
3. The outer conditional contains two branches. 
The second branch (the else from the outer) contains another 
if statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two 
branches could contain conditional statements as well.

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
